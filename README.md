# Paraphrase-Identification-Task
Paraphrase detection is the task of examining two text entities (ex. sentence) and determining whether they have the same meaning. In order to obtain high accuracy on this task, thorough syntactic and semantic analysis of the two text entities is required.

## What is Paraphrase?
In simple words, paraphrase is just an alternative representation of the same meaning.

## Classification of Paraphrases
According to granularity, paraphrases are of two types.
  * Surface Paraphrases
    - Lexical level
        * Example - ***solve*** and ***resolve***
    - Phrase level
        * Example - ***look after*** and ***take care of***
    - Sentence level
        * Example - ***The table was set up in the carriage shed*** and ***The table was laid under the cart-shed***
    - Discourse level
  * Structural paraphrases
   - Pattern level
        * Example - ***[X] considers [Y]*** and ***[X] takes [Y] into consideration***
   - Collocation level
        * Example - ***(turn on, OBJ ligth)*** and ***(switch on, OBJ light)***

According to paraphrase style, they can be classified into five types.
  * Trivial Change
      * Example - ***all the members of*** and ***all members of***
  * Phrase replacement
      * Example - ***There will be major cuts in the salaries of high-level civil servants*** and ***There will be major cuts in the salaries of senior officials***
  * Phrase reordering
      * Example - ***Last night, I saw TOM in the shopping mall*** and ***I saw Tom in the shopping mall last night***
  * Sentence split & merge
      * Example - ***He baught a computer which is very expensive*** and ***(1) He bought a computer. (2) The computer is very expensive.***
  * Complex paraphrase
      * Example - ***He said there will be major cuts in the salaries of high-level civil servants*** and ***He claimed to implement huge salary cut to senior civil servants***
